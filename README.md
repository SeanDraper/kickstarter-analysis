# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

This project was for the client Louise, who came close to reaching her Kickstarter fundraising goal for her play *Fever*. In an attempt to find relationships between certain datapoints for other Kickstarters and their outcomes, we can draw conclusions on how Louise can conduct future Kickstarters to the greatest success.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to analyze a series of Kickstarter campaigns for Louise. We first found the releationships between launch date and the outcome of each Kickstarter. Then we found the relationships between the goal amount for the Kickstater and its outcome.

## Analysis and Challenges

We were given a large dataset of thousands of Kickstarter campaigns. Since Louise was specifically running a Kickstarter for a play, we filtered down the Kickstarter dataset to include only data on theater and plays. We use CountIfs formulas, pivot tables, along with pivot charts to help Louise visualize the analysis that we conducted. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The first analysis for Louise was to determine the relationship between launch date and the outcome of each Kickstarter. We created a pivot table of all the Kickstarter data with filters for parent category and years, the month each Kickstarter was created, and then displayed the outcomes successful, failed, or canceled for each month. Using this pivot table, we created a pivot chart and specifically a stacked line chart to help Louise visualize this data. Using this chart, you can easily see how successful campaigns were based on the month they were started.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

We then ran analysis 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
